# CodePath Alumni Professional Interview Prep Course, November 2017 - January 2018

My situation: I already completed the July/August 2017 version of your Alumni Interview Prep Course, including doing the two Refdash interviews and continuing on to interview at Facebook. When Nathan and Tim posted to the CodePath Slack about this new "beefed up" eight-week version of the course, I asked whether part II of the new class would work as a part II followup class for the shorter version I had taken. Nathan said yes, that it would, and Tim asked if I would also be willing to participate in part I of the new class as a mentor. I was interested in that, but explained that I had a conflict on Tuesday, December 5, but could do the other days.

## Prework

As I said in [my InterviewBit profile gif](https://github.com/tachyonlabs/CodePath-Alumni-Professional-Interview-Prep-Course/blob/master/interviewbit-profile.gif), I've actually been using InterviewBit off and on since March (though I still have a ways to go before reaching Code Ninja status).

### Checkpoint 1
Checkpoint Level 1 is just a multiple-choice question on time complexity, not a coding problem, but this repo includes a screenshot of it with my answer:

### Checkpoint 3
For some reason [my profile](https://www.interviewbit.com/profile/Tachyon) is showing Level-Ups for Levels 1, 2, 4, and 5, but not 3, even though among other things I did the Checkpoint Level 3 prework problems below. Here also is [a screenshot of the Checkpoint Level 3 screen.](https://github.com/tachyonlabs/CodePath-Alumni-Professional-Interview-Prep-Course/blob/master/interviewbit_checkpoint_3.jpg)

### HackerRank Calibration Test
I took the HackerRank Calibration Test on November 13, and finished five of the six questions -- on one hand I assume you should have received my results by now, but on the other hand I never received an email confirmation after submitting it, whereas with the HackerRank tests I took during the July/August session, I did receive confirmations.
